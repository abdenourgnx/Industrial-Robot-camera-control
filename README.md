# Industrial-Robot-camera-control

This project consists of two parts: a robot camera controller and a remote controller for the camera. Both devices are built using a Raspberry Pi and programmed in C++. The devices communicate with each other through the RS485 protocol.

#### Robot Camera Controller
The robot camera controller is a device that is mounted on a robot and controls the movement and operation of a camera. It is responsible for capturing and sending images to the remote controller.

#### Remote Controller
The remote controller is a device that receives images from the robot camera controller and displays them on a screen. It also allows the user to control the movement and operation of the camera remotely by sending VISCA commands to control the camera parameters and movement.
